## coding literacy and coding otherwise 

#### before doing any text reading:

The basic meaning of reading and writing skills is the ability to read and write; reading is absorption, the identification of written material, and writing is output, the ability to interpret, create, communicate, and calculate. There are different norms for reading and writing in different contexts, so it is the ability to recognize and express in a particular language. I believe that the more languages one has mastered, the wider the range of recognition and the richer the dimensions of expression, which would otherwise be translated into the native language first and translated into the native context.

Computer programming started out in people's consciousness as a vocational skill and is rapidly becoming more popular today. It is a language in which humans talk to computers, and to understand this language in the context of computing networks, we need to learn new symbols and terminology and learn the logic of its language, which I think is about the logic of mathematics and English, covering algebra, and derivative operations, guiding the computer to execute. If there is an error in execution, we have to assume and then output to verify the assumption. Mastering the language of computing, being able to read and understand code, design and write programs to make the computer solve problems for us, is the literacy of the information age.
It has become an essential literacy for the digital age, and we need to have the ability to understand digital technology and information. Mastering the ability to program is like the transformation that comes with mastering the ability to read and write, greatly increasing people's productivity.

#### after reading the assigned text:

Having programming literacy means having a basic understanding of coding concepts, syntax, and structure and being able to apply programming languages. I read Live Coding: A User's Manual with coding literacy in mind. Chapter 7 mentions that live coding is a technical practice, a specific type of knowledge and way of thinking in craft and artistic processes, practices, and research [1]. It includes artistic and technical as well as philosophical inquiry. This statement makes me feel closer to live coding. Artistic and philosophical literacy is more adequate than technical. It is a way of creating order in art and philosophy with code. Still, code can often resist the intentions of its creators and can undermine the body of knowledge it circulates as performance, computational culture, etc. So the potential to break expectations and introduce uncertainty is important. Live coding further expands the range of possibilities for knowledge production. We need to make quick decisions about what they can and cannot do, and all decisions may be made by chance, which requires a higher level of literacy than normal coding.

It may seem that real-time coding is a bit complicated. Still, in Sam Aaron's Programming as Performance video[2], I was amazed at how simple and accessible the rendition of real-time coding is. Because the source code is developed and shared through software, and it's free. It is possible to bring improvisation to life at such a low cost. We can put realistic code into action by understanding one side, whether it's music or code. The confusion that we don't have to be professional programmers has never given me much confidence in learning programming. Programming is just a tool for creative expression. I could read, understand, modify, create programs, and create my art with programming literacy.
