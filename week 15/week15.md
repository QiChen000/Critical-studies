Akinsola Lawanson’s short film Bosode is a 27-minute moving image. The film explores the Ifá religion (which originated from the Yorùbá ethnic group from West Africa), divination systems, and binary mathematics. The film is inspired by Nollywoood horror and Nigerian magical realist literature. Danying Chen’s practice centers on emotional attachment. Revisiting childhood memories of the Buddhist spirituality of her hometown, Chen’s work looks at how images of gods, praying, emotions, wishes, and selfish desires are portrayed.

The film is influenced by the work of West African magical realism Tomi Adeyemi, an examination of oppression, racism and slavery in the fantasy novel Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi, where virtual characters act as stand-ins for the real world and help shape it through their actions.

What I like most about this work is its fantasy. A conch is an object of attachment in traditional religion. She sees it as a communication tool like a cell phone to connect with God and finally throws it back into the sea to represent that she is not afraid of such religion. Regarding the filming technique, double exposure is applied in the middle part to show the blurring of virtual and reality. The artist should have short descriptions between each section to facilitate the audience's understanding. The film is a novel idea, and the open ending is a way to bring the audience to think about how we can decide our destiny when more powerful beings are around.

The subject matter of religion is very sensitive, and the artist's film is bold and measured, opening my awareness and understanding of religious and artistic expression. At the same time, the magic realism approach is interesting, and I can apply it to my creations.
