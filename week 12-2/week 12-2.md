## Identify a Research Topic 
In September 2019, my mother passed away. When I forgot to top up her phone six months later, I found out that telecommunications companies had been deregistered her number. Subsequently, I cannot retrieve the online account registered with the mobile number. I feel so sad that I lost my mother’s memory on the internet. I wish I could find a way to preserve my mother’s memories on the internet, making a lifeless digital vitalized and soothing me as emotional comfort.
So my research topic is digital heritage.

## Conduct my first search for relevant academic literature.
Ual library online search 

The first search was in the bibliography of my university library, which yielded 84 results. After a cursory look at the catalog, the results were all related to cultural heritage, after which I looked up other English language references to heritage. Understanding that inheritance is the legal meaning of heritage, I changed the keyword to digital inheritance to be more accurate and got ten results. I needed more efficient literature. So I changed my search word to include the term 'digital afterlives' and only came up with one book, The digital afterlives of Jane Austen: Janeites at the keyboard / by Kylie Mirmohamadi.

google scholar 

A search for digital afterlives in google scholar produced 24900 results. So I need to narrow down my search. Put the search terms in inverted commas so that they were treated as a single phrase rather than as two separate keywords. A search on [“digital afterlives”] produced 476 hits – better, but still too many for an initial search for broad introductory information. 

I changed the search word, and a search for [digital afterlives] yielded 476 results. After that, I restricted the publication date and searched for ["digital afterlives"] between 2022 and 2023 and found 96 results. This yielded a long list of books on digital afterlives, including one on The Creation and Inheritance of Digital Afterlives. The valuable information that follows comes from a chapter in this book. This includes The Future of Digital Death, Losing the Data of the Dead, and Expanding Existing Models of Bereavement. I typed the name of the decomposed book into The creation of a digital afterlife. The search yielded three results.My search for the subdivided chapter name The Future of Digital Death produced two ef fluent results, and they were valid. So search details are more precise under good books.
