## Critical Reflection of Field Trip 

I was interested in the exhibition on the negative floor of the Design Museum on the theme of ASMR (Autonomic Sensory Meridian Response), a perceptual phenomenon in which the senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, etc., stimulate the scalp, back and limbs to produce pleasurable responses, such as itchy skin on the head and neck and goosebumps. This exhibition brings the world of ASMR from the screen to the physical space, with a sequential narrative of visual, auditory, and tactile sensations in a multi-media, interactive way that allows people to experience the wonders of ASMR.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115136747/227270951-4a266c05-1394-4ad8-a8fa-e42c1139758b.png)

Before entering the exhibition, I was given a coin with my ticket. The staff said it would enhance your experience of the exhibition and immediately made me curious about its content. What was the connection between the coin and ASMR? How would it stimulate my senses?![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115136747/227270998-a29693f9-eef9-40ba-8e6b-f1d14768d368.png)

As soon as I walked into the exhibition, the main color of beige and white made me feel comfortable and relaxed, and I was met with long, hand-like memory pillows in the center of the space, wrapping around people. It is less like a museum and more like a bedroom. Viewers lie inside and watch different types of ASMR videos, allowing people who are anxious in a high-pressure society to relax and heal. The hands are surrounded by visual and auditory sensory stimulation, and the center of the hands is tactile. At first, the logic of the exhibit was not clearer to me, and I don't know which part to watch first. Seeing the number of people in the memory pillow, I had to watch the video display first. I rethought the order of its exhibits. Suppose the hand is opened, and the memory pillow extends from the floor to the wall, arranged after the visual and auditory multimedia video. In that case, people will not experience the warm feeling of being wrapped in the hand and will be confronted with the flow of people in the exhibition and will not be able to feel it quietly. Compared to the sequencing, the curator's use of space and the expression of the theme is spot on. The most interesting part of the exhibition is the last part of the studio, which has a microphone installation, two microphones are linked to the left and right channels of the headphones, and you can choose the tools to make an arr on site. I saw the exhibition alone and tried the experience with a stranger on site, and it was amazing how hearing each other's production of ASMR created an inexplicable intimacy. At the end of the exhibition, the coins that I had been carrying in my pocket could finally be taken out and thrown into the funnel-like device, and the sound of the coins spinning created an ASMR effect, which I had not expected. The placement of the coin installation at the end can take the viewer to the end of the exhibition.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115136747/227271046-c3d8b9e7-9c30-4f7e-b103-b4d4a1d82

If I were running the exhibition, I would hang some robes next to the memory pillows to make it more immersive or replace the memory pillows with massage chairs. In addition, I would add an olfactory component to the visual, auditory, and olfactory senses. For example, the scent of flowers, freshly baked bread, etc.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115136747/227271074-b9baf448-3b7d-436f-99b4-bc64ec351af1.png)

My initial perception of intracranial orgasm was somewhat stereotypical and prejudiced, believing it to be about sex and desire, probably not just for me but for many people distracted by videos on the internet. This exhibition introduced a plurality of perspectives that helped me to understand and appreciate the multifaceted and complex nature of intracranial orgasm. A study at Swansea University found that 85% of ASMR consumers, who use it to assist in falling asleep, and only 5% of whom will experience sexual arousal, are not much associated with sexual arousal [2]. This exhibition brings ASMR into a mainstream communication perspective, reshaping people's understanding of ASMR culture with the most direct experience; it is not the same as pornography, nor is it a niche subculture that can bring physical benefits to people in the online world. It uses digital technology to create new avenues of solace for lonely people. It challenges and resists the oppressive society under power, allowing people to focus and slow down, and return to natural relaxation.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115136747/227271129-ad102c23-b18c-4199-be10-2febc5dcfe00.png)
