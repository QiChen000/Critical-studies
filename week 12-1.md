## Space Station
"Daddy, my eyes hurt." the man looks at his child in helplessness and does not know how to respond. This situation has become commonplace in Bhopal, India.One day, Ram, a disabled person from Bhopal, found Stephen. Ram, a Union Carbide India Limited veteran employee, was involved in the 1984 Bhopal incident, which resulted in a curvature of the spine. After that, He walks on all fours with his arms and legs. Stephen is an environmental lawyer who resolves disputes for chemical companies. After Ram was disabled in an industrial accident and found that many others were blinded by severe eye pain after exposure to isocyanate gas in the air, they rallied and allied, hoping that Stephen would bring them justice.

He wrote in the complaint that those compensations could not bring us back to our original life after all. I hope the government will provide technical support for the space station led by people with disabilities and design tools and environments for our world. In this accident, most people lost their eyesight, and some suffered severe damage to their nasal cavities and bronchi. Taking into account the needs of various disabilities, from vision to mobility impairments and neurological diseases, of course, we must also consider the psychological shadow and mental burden caused by accidents. We need interaction designers, architects, engineers, and scientists to create barrier-free passages and audio maps of transportation systems based on our cognition through artificial intelligence. In addition, the space station should have good air quality, lighting, sound, and temperature. Basic amenities such as controls ensure comfort and fitness. Access to family and friends is made possible by the internet and accessible meeting spaces. We need advanced medical technology and psychologists to help us restore our physical and mental health, especially the gynecological health of the disabled. Many children born after the gas leak have congenital disabilities.

Adhering to disability justice, the recruitment of the space station is open to a wide range of people and requires the joint construction of disabled and non-disabled people. We value not only our employees' skills, knowledge, and work experience but also assess their ability to work together and commitment to creating an inclusive community. In addition to these, we also set up a public relations department. We insist on independence and pursue accessibility as friction. We need to attract more companions to create more possibilities.We proclaim our values, "We are no longer called "animals," once we were human beings! "We embrace differences and not be overwhelmed. Our space station is inclusive, diverse, and respectful. The station holds regular meetings, social events, and recreational activities to make each person with a disability feel like they belong, to encourage them to share their experiences and stories, to communicate and interact with non-disabled people to promote mutual understanding and respect and to provide the necessary support and resources.

Stephen understood the demands of the Ram space station and chose to stand at the forefront for them, giving Ram hope in despair. He said, "In the final analysis, we protect ourselves. There is no one else but us, every ordinary person."
