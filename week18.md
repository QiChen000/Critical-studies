## The "stupid" kitchen AI system

Most of the developments and applications of AI receive a lot of attention with the goal of "building new tools for the benefit of humanity." Compared to AI, silly AI systems are rarely talked about, but they should be taken more seriously. I will discuss the pros and cons of developing stupid AI systems that can cook.

I think of stupid AI systems as people reducing the intelligence of computer programs by human intervention to achieve some purpose, making AI systems deliberately make mistakes to look more like people.

For the intelligent system that can cook, people will reject it because she has no soul and no taste of her mother.Then the stupid robot kitchen system will be deliberately designed to use a slower moving speed, through the visual system, to track human movement to generate a set of cooking procedures. Even if your mother adds too much salt and makes up for it by adding sugar will be replicated in it. It will not judge which procedures are wrong and redundant.

The purpose of the "stupid" kitchen AI system is not to enhance the AI system itself but to shape the human perception of the AI system so that it appears smarter and more humane and does not feel cold and manufactured by the machine. A silly kitchen intelligence system can enhance the diner experience and inspire the diner. In addition, a stupid kitchen system can help us understand the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The downside is that it cannot judge the cooking situation by smell like humans do nor adjust the cooking process according to its own judgment.

A brilliant kitchen robot can avoid kitchen disasters caused by habitual mistakes in human cooking and will not be influenced by emotions that cause the meal to taste different every time it is made. It can calculate food ratios very precisely, and such standardization allows people to have balanced meals. This standardization is very suitable for office workers who need a quick solution to their meal problems and institutions like hospitals and schools.
