## Low Technology and Community Practice Reflection

I paid attention to low-tech designs a long time ago. For example, in the cheap high-speed manual centrifuge designed by Stanford researchers 17 years, only the plastic tube containing the blood sample is pasted on the optimized drawstring toy, and it is transformed into The "paper centrifuge" can separate plasma in 90 seconds, and isolate malaria parasites in 15 minutes. It solves a big problem for medical services in poor areas. And the o-wind wind power generation device also won the global champion of the Dyson Design Award in 2018. It uses a simple sphere with geometric vents to ensure the wind can rotate when it normally blows, filling the city with wind energy and solving the problem. The great challenge of renewable energy.

We can see through these two cases that the three principles of low-tech design are useful and can provide a healthy lifestyle in different areas such as energy, video, water, waste management, and materials—accessible, simple, easy to make, and low cost. Sustainable, ecological technology allows you to think about and optimize the environmental, social, or societal impacts of using that technology.

There are many applications of low-industrial design in life, but I have yet to think of it because of the use of small technologies in network infrastructure. Small technologies can run on limited CPU, memory, disk space, and bandwidth by using simple tools and protocols. For example, Low-Tech Magazine (2018) runs only on servers powered by solar panels, resulting in increased energy efficiency. It reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions and makes it more cost-effective and accessible to a wider range of people. And we can test the effectiveness of different materials to reduce energy production or create the software from old hardware that can be converted into new resources.

It is flexible in that it can choose the server that receives the sunlight, and at the same time, its electricity power determines the site's visual design. This lightweight site can be easily appropriated but has a certain vulnerability. This concept doesn't apply to game festivals and car manufacturers because they add hard-to-fix applications, a risk faced by low-power single-board computers. So this design with a small footprint on the environment has very limited functionality.

Another challenge is that such a small network infrastructure and services based on free labor can only be adopted by a privileged few with the time and means to do so and can only be adopted and adapted by diverse communities if such labor is valued. So
wanting economic progress or broader access requires a greater investment in labor to solve the restoration problem. It is a significant barrier in areas with limited resources.

In conclusion, complex high-technology innovation to achieve ecological transformation is dangerous. In contrast, small and low technology is the key to solving global challenges. However, the application of low and small technology design still has to consider the applicability of the environment.!
